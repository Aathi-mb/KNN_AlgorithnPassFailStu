# Student Pass / Fail Prediction using KNN

This project predicts whether a student will **PASS or FAIL**
based on the number of hours studied using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement
To predict student performance (Pass/Fail) using machine learning
based on study time.

---

## 🤖 Algorithm Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

KNN works by comparing a new student's study time with the
nearest existing students and predicting the majority result.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Streamlit

---

## 📊 Input
- Study Time (Hours)

## 📈 Output
- PASS ✅
- FAIL ❌
